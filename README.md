## Hey!

I'm a Software Engineering Lead @ Specsavers! I do still get to code from time to time and I'll make whatever I can make public, public. I also keep some non-code stuff here too, like these [talks](https://github.com/matthewpeterbailey/Presentations).

I have experience with a bunch of tools and am pretty language agnostic, although I have most experience with TS (Node.js) and C# (.NET). 

I've architected and developed web applications, CLIs, APIs, databases and overseen migrations of enterprise solutions into the cloud. I'm passionate about implementing governance and good engineering practice in a pragmatic way that doesn't slow technical teams down, but instead empowers them to fail-fast and learn faster.
